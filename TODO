TODO:
 - Test cases

 - Documentation

 - Binary protocol (not text) support
   ?? Unclear if packing/unpacking will be faster than stringifying

 - h['pg_client_encoding']

 - BLOB support
   ?? as blob objects?

 - array support

DONE:
 - parameterized query support

 - dbd_db.do() direct (unprepared) execution implementation

 - workaround dbi-0.4.3 default String parameter conversion
   It quotes, but we want the backend to do that

 - support precision, scale in dbd_db.columns, dbd_st.column_info
   (without extraneous SQL lookup)

 - 'async' connection and execution
   i.e., don't block ruby threads

 - dbd_st.finish implies DEALLOCATE
   n.b.: forgotten statements are never DEALLOCATEd, and that's ok

 - avoid PREPAREd statement name collision
