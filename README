= Description
    dbd-altpg is a PostgreSQL database driver for the Ruby DBI project
    with performance-sensitive functions written directly in C against
    PostgreSQL's client library, libpq.

    By contrast, the standard DBI driver "dbd-pg" is a pure ruby
    implementation which adapts the excellent ruby-pg libpq bindings to
    the DBI-DBD API.

= Synopsis

    require 'dbi'
    
    DBI.connect("dbi:AltPg:#{$pg_database}", $user, $pass) do |dbh|
        dbh.prepare('SELECT * FROM my_report') do |sth|
            sth.execute
            sth.fetch { |row| my_pretty_print(row) }
        end

        ... do whatever you'd do with a pg database!  ...
        ... except see "Bugs, Limitations and ToDo :) ...

    end

= Prerequisites

    >= ruby-dbi-0.4.3

= Installation
    None yet -- see the next section.

= Bugs, Limitations and ToDo
    Non-parameterized statements and basic (output) type conversions work.

    Several points of DBI compliance (dbh.tables, e.g.) are unimplemented
    as of yet, and no pg-specific functionality (e.g., COPY, PG arrays,
    ``dbh.func :anything'') are available yet.

    See the TODO file for more details.
